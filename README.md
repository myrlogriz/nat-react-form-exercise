Given the AC for this task, I could use multiple approaches, such as:

1. Using libraries like React Hook Form or Formik.
2. Building a form with React v18 or earlier.
3. Building a form with React v19 and the new Form Actions feature.

While using libraries can be very helpful, especially in the case of complex forms, because they promise to "take care of the repetitive and annoying stuffâ€”keeping track of values, errors, visited fields, orchestrating validation, and handling submission," and I have used Formik in the past in combination with Yup for validation, for this exercise, I decided not to use a library. Instead, I wanted to try using Form Actions since I have never done it before (the latest version of React I used was 17) and I'm curious about how it works.

### Some other technologies that could be used but were avoided to prevent overcomplicating the form exercise:
- TypeScript
- Installing and configuring ESLint and Prettier

### Bundler choices:
- Webpack
- Vite (choice)
- Parcel

### CSS choices:
- BEM (choice)
- CSS Modules
- CSS-in-JS
